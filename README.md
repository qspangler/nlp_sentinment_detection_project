# nlp_sentinment_detection_project

Running the bmnlp_app_v6.py file will allow you to run an interesting sentiment analysis on a movie script. I chose the "Bee Movie" as an example, but you could edit the code to incorporate any body of text. 

The app shows overall trends in general sentiment over time and specific sentiments and emotions at specific points in the text. 

Any feedback is appreciated.
