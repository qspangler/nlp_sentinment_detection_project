## nlp_sentinment_detection_project

Running the bmnlp_app_v6.py file will allow you to run an interesting sentiment analysis on a movie script. I chose the "Bee Movie" as an example, but you could edit the code to incorporate any body of text. 

Simply run the file from your local command line interface. After a beat, the app will load and initialize.

The app shows overall trends in general sentiment over time and specific sentiments and emotions at specific points in the text. 

Any feedback is appreciated.
